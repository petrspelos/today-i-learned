## Using GitHub pages, the index page shows 404

This happened to me recently. The index page shows fine if the file is specifically requested ie. spelos.net/index.html

The way I fixed this is pretty strange. All I needed to do was select a Jekyll theme in the Settings section of my repository. This is required even if I don't use Jekyll. Pretty strange.
